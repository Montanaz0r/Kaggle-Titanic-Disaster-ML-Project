# Bogusz Janiak ML Project - The Titanic Disaster

This notebook will show a full workflow of building a classification model for the Titanic Disaster competition at Kaggle. This is a beginner level contest that focuses on Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. The best score I have achieved using the techniques presented in this notebook is **0.80382%**, and this currently places me in the **top 8%** of all competitors.

The project has six main sections:
1. Introduction  
2. Explanatory Data Analysis  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Pre-Modeling Tasks  
5. Modeling  
6. Final prediction & submission
